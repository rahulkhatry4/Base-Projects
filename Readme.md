The following Repo consists of the following content

1) Analysis
  * E-commerce Analysis for the Brazillian e-commerce company olist<br>
  * Social Network analysis of Huwavei Facebook Social Network Data<br>

2) Big Data<br>
  * Building a recommendation system using mllib from pyspark to make a book recommendation system<br>

3) Dashboards<br>
  * A Dash App for building a dashboard for the e-commerce analysis perfoemed in 1.a.<br>

4) Machine Learning<br>
  * Reinforcement Learning 
    * Simple Q-learning agent to solve Taxi problem<br>
  * Tensorflow(v1.13) estimators (which are the most scalable and production oriented model types)<br>
    * Premade estimator for dense models<br>
    * Custom estimators with dense layers<br>
    * Custom made estimators with convolutional neural network models<br>
    * custom estimators with bidirection LSTM networks for sentiment classification<br>

5) Microservices<br>
  * Creating an example front end microservice (Dash App)<br>
  * Backend Microservice (Django based REST API)(Also a meetup scraping API that I made for a hackathon)<br>
  * Respective Docker Files and YAML files for deploying docker images and minikube deployemnts and services<br>
  * Bash scripts for semi-automating a build pipeline with single commands (the world is tied together with bash scripts :P)<br>
    The frontend and backend built in this fashion also talk to each other and have the ports adjusted <br>
    (though the messages API would need to be developed further)<br>
    

6) Kubeflow Pipelines<br>
  * A bash script that I use to start a new minikube VM with kubeflow installed in it and default namespace adjustment in a 
  single command<br>
  * (I'm also working on a minikube deployment of akubeflow pipeline but seems to have an issue (see kubeflow documentation), Will upload as soon as I can come up with one
